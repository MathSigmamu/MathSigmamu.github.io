        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>
          B.A Hons Three Dimensional Design - Manchester Metropolitan University 2016
          </p>
        <p>
        Masters of Design Studies (Technology) - Harvard University 2018
        </p>
        
        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
        <h4 style= "width: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><u>Sigmamu Studio, UK—Co-Director/ Computational designer</u></h4>
        <h6 style =  "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%);">Sept 2020 - PRESENT
        </h6>
        <h5 style = "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%); text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Co- founded Sigamamu studio, this is a design consultation studio focused on
          developing solutions to design problems through the use of computational design
          techniques as well as designing solutions with modern technologies including micro
          electronics and digital fabrication. Through this I have worked on various projects
          including developing Javascript webtools, rewriting and optimizing grasshopper scripts,
          developing designs for small scale architecture.</h5>



          <h4 style= "width: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><u>New Balance, USA— Technical Designer 2</u></h4>
          <h6 style =  "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%);">January 2019 - September 2019
          </h6>
          <h5 style = "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%); text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Worked as Technical Designer 2 for New balance. In this role I created computational
            design tools for new balance to help designers develop designs faster. Some of these tools
            were written in C# for Grasshopper to aid the computational design department. I also
            developed tools in Javascript, Java, processing and python in order to develop tools based
            on Photoshop in order to create tools which could be used by less computationally skilled
            designers. I also worked on using computational design techniques such as agent based
            simulation in conjunction with data collected from athletes in order to create high
            performance data driven designs.</h5>



            <h4 style= "width: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><u>Harvard University , USA— Teaching Assistant</u></h4>
            <h6 style =  "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%);">January 2018 - May 2018
            </h6>
            <h5 style = "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%); text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">Worked as a Teaching Assistant for "Digital Media 2" Class at Harvard University. The
              focus of this class was to teach students the skills and thought processes required to
              create interactive designs. Through this I taught and ran classes in C++ for
              arduino/proton, how to collect data and then reinterpret it to create interactive designs,
              And help the students develop the design aesthetics of their project.</h5>


              <h4 style= "width: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><u>Jali Ltd, UK—R&D Researcher </u></h4>
              <h6 style =  "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%);">August 2014 - July 2016
              </h6>
              <h5 style = "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%); text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                I worked as a researcher in the manufacturing and design research department. Through this I worked on various projects from developing manufacturing methods for large scale industrial robots including 3D printing techniques and flame cutting. I also worked on reorganising the company's factory layout in order to increase efficiency. Finally I worked on smaller scale projects including developing a 3D printer in order to increase prototype development and give customers a better idea of what the custom product they would receive was going to look like
                </h5>




                
              <h4 style= "width: 50%; transform: translateX(50%);"><u>Ockenden Engineering, UK—Cad Designer</u></h4>
              <h6 style =  "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%);">July 2011 - August 2014
              </h6>
              <h5 style = "width:50%; transform: translateX(50%); text-align:justify; text-justify: inter-word;">
                Generated 2D sheet metal drawings in solidworks for various projects ranging from small
scale automotive parts to large scale commercial engineering projects such as developing
a carbon neutral power generators
